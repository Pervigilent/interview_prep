
Andy and Stewart's Interview Preparation:

(1) Conduct at least 2 mock interviews per month, including coding questions.
(2) Start off doing freeCodeCamp and focus on
	(a) Coding Interview Prep - please put your submissions in the Github repository
	(b) JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification - to learn JavaScript
(3) Buy and share a subscription to AlgoExpert and Leetcode.
(4) Create an application timeline
	(a) Stewart

How to PASS a Coding Interview - Tips, Advice & Resources
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckW4cUqui_w

Tech With Tim recommends:
(A) AlgoExpert https://www.algoexpert.io/techwithtim
(B) Leetcode Premium https://leetcode.com/subscribe/

My steps for solving interview questions
(1) Analyze the problem thoroughly
(2) Reduce ambiguity and ask the necessary questions 
(3) Diagram or draw out the problem 
(4) Consider different solutions and their space time complexity
(5) Choose the best solution you can implement in the time given
(6) Discuss and explain in-depth exactly what you are going to do
(7) Convince the interviewer your solution is correct before you start coding 
(8) Translate your solution to code while explaining each step as you go (ensure it does seem like you are merely reciting a memorized solution)
(9) Communicate with your interviewer about your thought process and listen for any potential feedback or hints from them
(10) If your interviewer gives you a hint ensure you incorporate it into your solution
(11) Talk about advantages and disadvantages of your solution and the space time complexity
