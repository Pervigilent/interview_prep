Andy,

I am watching YouTube episodes on coding interviews. I will summarize my findings and suggestions in this document. I will put all example code on the Github repository. I suggest several things:

(1) We should conduct 2 mock interviews per month, including coding questions.
(2) We should start off doing freeCodeCamp and focus on
	(a) Coding Interview Prep - please put your submissions in the Github repository
	(b) JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
(2) We should buy and share a subscription to AlgoExpert and Leetcode.
